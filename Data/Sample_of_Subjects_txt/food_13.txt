  4          cups  flour -- sifted
       1           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  shortening
       2                eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4         pound  sesame seeds -- about 2/3 to 3/4 cup

Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.  Heat the oven to 375F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or two knives, until the pieces are the size of small peas.  Stir in the eggs and the milk (1 tablespoon at a time) to make a soft dough.  Mix together thoroughly. Break the dough into small pieces and roll each between the palms of your hands to form rolls about 1 1/2 inches in length.  Flatten the rolls slightly and roll them in the sesame seeds.  Place about 3/4 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until thee cookies are lightly browned.  Makes about 6 dozen cookies.
