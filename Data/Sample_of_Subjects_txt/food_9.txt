       1           cup  almonds -- unblanched
       1           cup  white flour -- unsifted
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  turbinado sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       3         large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Roast almonds in a 350F oven for 10-15 minutes until lightly browned. Cool to room temperature.  Mix together dry ingredients in a large bowl reserving about 1 cup.  Lightly beat eggs and vanilla and add. Work mixture until dough coheres adding reserved dry ingredients if necessary. Add nuts and knead until they are evenly distributed. Divide into thirds and rest for a few minutes.  Then shape into slabs about 1" wide and 12-14" long.  Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake at 300F for 50 minutes. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes then cut diagonal bars 1/2" thick.  Lay the cookies on their sides and return to the oven for 50 minutes.  Store in a paper bag for 5-6 days before serving.  Yield: about 4 dozen.

The result depends heavily on your mixing technique and on the flour you use.  If your first batch resembles a sack of small bricks, try (try) again.
