  2 1/4          cups  flour
   1 1/4          cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
                        salt
       3                eggs -- lightly beaten
       1    tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        zest of 1 orange -- fine grated
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped almonds
                        vegetable shortening

1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour baking sheet. Shake off excess. 

2. In a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together. Make a well in center of mixture. To the well add remaining ingredients. With your hands, work dry mixture with liquids until a dough has been formed. Divide the dough in half. 

3. On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into 2 flat-bottomed cylinders, 1 in. high, 2 1/2 in. wide and 8 in. long. Remove each to the baking sheet. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly colored on top. Remove from oven and cool slightly. 

4. Holding a long sharp knife by the handle and tip; cut cylinders diagonally into 3/4-in. slices. Carefully place slices back on baking sheet, cut sides down; return to oven for 15 minutes more and bake until sides are golden and biscotti have dried a bit. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. The biscotti should be somewhat hard and crunchy. 

Yield: 20 to 24 biscotti.  You can also dip one end into some melted chocolate, for a nice effect and great taste.
