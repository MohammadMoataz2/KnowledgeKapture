 2          cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  whole unblanched almonds
     3/4           cup  finely ground unblanched almonds
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/3           cup  honey
     1/3           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

In medium bowl, mix flour, sugar, whole almonds, finely ground almonds, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In separate bowl, blend honey, water and almond extract.

Add to dry ingredients and mix until well-blended. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half and form each portion into a log about 12" x 2" x 3/4".

Place logs onto baking sheet coated with nonstick spray. Bake 30 minutes at 250 degrees. Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes. Place log on cutting board. With a serrated knife, cut log diagonally into 1/2" slices, using a sawing motion.

Place slice, with the cut side up, on baking sheet and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Centers will be slightly soft, but will harden as they cool. Remove from oven and place on wire rack to cool.
