DIRECTIONS This recipe is for 4 but can be cut in half for 2. I usually make the whole thing up so I can enjoy it the next day for lunch or as a side dish when completely mixed into the rice.  I holds well in the fridge if covered tightly. Cut chicken into strips. Toss with 1 TBS soy and set aside.  Mix together remaining soy, chicken broth and cornstarch.  Set aside. Heat 1 1/2 TBS oil in wok or large fry pan and quickly stir fry the drained chicken strips until browned.  Be sure wok is hot.Remove from wok and keep warm. Add remaining oil to wok and stir fry all veggies over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Add the broth mix, bring to a boil--stirring constantly. Return chicken to the wok, add the nuts and heat about one minute.  Serve immediately over white rice. Please try the sticky rice, folks. Once you d you will probably never go back to the minute again. The oil can be cut back if you desire without affecting the final results. BTW, is anyone out there reading the posts of those who are taking their time? How about joining in for some variety. I know would like some new ones such as from  Kathleen and Rita and Frank and Bev etc., etc., etc.. GUY  FROM:       GUY ATTWOOD (NFWF89A)
