  8          each  leeks, white & green part only
       1         stick  butter
       4        medium  potatoes -- peel & finely dice
       1          each  carrot -- thinly sliced
       4          cups  chicken broth -- heated

Cut leeks in half lengthwise and then crosswise in 1 inch pieces.  Simmer gently in butter for about 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, carrot, chicken broth and water.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  Cook over just enough heat to keep soup at low boil for 40 minutes or until potatoes can be mashed easily against sides of pan.  Let cool slightly and put through blender.  Return to stove.  Stir in scant cup of milk.  Adjust seasonings.  Garnish each serving with chopped parsley.
