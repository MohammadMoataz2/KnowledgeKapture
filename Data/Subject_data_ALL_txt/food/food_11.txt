Stir in almonds.  Divide dough in half.  Shape each portion into a 12x2x1-inch loaf.  Place 6 inches apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Beat the egg white until foamy.  Brush over tops of loaves.  Bake in 375F oven 20 to 25 minutes or until light brown.  Cool on cookie sheet about 1 hour.  Cut each loaf diagonally into 1/2- inch thick slices.
