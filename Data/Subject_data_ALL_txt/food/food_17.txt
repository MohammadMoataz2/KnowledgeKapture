This comes from the Dallas Morning News' "Dallas Life Magazine". The Highland Park restaurant Patrizio contributes this recipe for biscotti.  Combine butter, sugar and eggs, mixing well. Beat in vanilla.  Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and chopped nuts. Add to the egg mixture. The batter will be very stiff and sticky. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or over night.  With floured hands, divide the dough into two portions and shape each into a loaf about 12 inched long.  Grease a 10 by 14 baking sheet. Place both loaves on the sheet, leaving at least 3 inches between them. Flatten each loaf slightly, as evenly as possible.  Place in preheated 400 degree oven and bake for 20 min. or until firm to the touch.  Remove can cool on wire rack slightly. Lower oven to 375.  While still warm, slice the loaves into diagonal slices about 1/3 inch thick.  Arrange on ungreased baking sheet and bake at 375 fro 15 mintues - do not brown.  Var.
