     1/2           cup  (1 stick) butter or margarine
       1           cup  granulated sugar
       2         large  eggs
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
   2 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
   1 3/4          cups  mini chocolate baking bits -- divided
       1           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
       2   tablespoons  instant coffee granules

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Lightly grease cookie sheets; set aside. 

In large bowl cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy; beat in eggs and vanilla. 

In medium bowl combine flour, baking powder and baking soda; blend into creamed mixture. Dough will be stiff. 

Stir in 1 1/4 cups mini chocolate baking bits and nuts. 

Divide dough in half. Add cocoa powder and coffee granules to one half of the dough, mixing to blend. 

On well-floured surface, gently knead doughs together just enough to marble. Divide dough in half and gently roll each half into 12 x 2-inch log; place on prepared cookie sheets at least 4 inches apart.

Press remaining 1/2 cup mini chocolate baking bits onto outside of both logs. 

Bake 25 minutes. Dough will spread. 

Cool logs 15 to 20 minutes. Slice each log into 12 slices; arrange on cookie sheet cutside down. 

Bake an additional 10 minutes. (For softer biscotti, omit second baking.) 

Cool completely. 

Store in tightly covered container.
