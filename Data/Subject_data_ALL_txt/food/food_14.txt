     3/4           cup  almonds -- unblnchd,fine ground
     1/2      teaspoon  bicarbonate of ammonia
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     3/4           cup  almonds -- whole, unblanched

Be careful with the first baking of these biscotti. Even though they are baked a second time after being cut, if they do not bake sufficiently the first time, the biscotti will have a hard, heavy core.  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine all ingredients except honey and water in a mixing bowl and stir a minute or 2 to mix. Add the honey and water and stir until a firm dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and divide in half. Roll each half into a log about 15 inches long. Place both logs, well apart, on a jelly roll pan lined with parchment or buttered wax paper. Bake about 30 minutes, until well risen, firm and a dark golden color. Remove from oven, cool logs slightly and place on a cutting board. Slice the logs diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals.  Return the cut biscotti to the pan, cut side down, and bake an additional 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dry. Cool on the pan. Store in a tin--they keep well.
