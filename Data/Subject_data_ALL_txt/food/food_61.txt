The Juice from Sea-buckthorn Berries
Sea-buckthorn Berries May Produce a Juice so Rich in Vitamins and Antioxidants That It may be Considered a Tonic For the Heart.

Most of us have never even heard of a sea-buckthorn bush let alone the fact that the berries of this plant are a potential tonic for our hearts. Well these berries do exist and they are filled with cholesterol reducing compounds that may prevent arteries from clogging.

Sea-buckthorn berries are found from the Atlantic coast of Europe to China, although sea-buckthorn bushes seem to thrive in the semi arid deserts of central Asia.

The juice of sea-buckthorn berries has long been used in China, Tibet, Mongolia, and Russia as a health drink. Due to the acidic nature of the berries, they are not pleasant to eat. However, when mixed with other sweet juices such as apple or grape they are much more palatable for our consumption. This juice is full of vitamin C, vitamin E, amino acids, and minerals that may prevent bad cholesterol from becoming oxidized thus reducing an individualâ€™s risk of coronary artery disease.

Recently, a new process has been developed to extract the juice of the sea-buckthorn berry that allows forty percent of the original polyphenol, fifty percent of the flavonoids and seventy percent of the vitamin C to remain in the juice. The improvement in the extraction process may enable the juice to become more marketable for western consumers as a preventative tonic for the heart.
