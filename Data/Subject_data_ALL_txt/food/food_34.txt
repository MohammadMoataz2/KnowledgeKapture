Make a marinade for the frilled vegetables by combining oil, vinegar, shallot, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper. Lightly toss the mushroom, peppers, carrot and zucchini in the marinade.

Grill vegetables for 5 minutes maximum. Midway through, turn vegetables over. (Or roast in a 425 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes.) Towards the end of the cooking time, toast bread. To assemble, slice mushroom and bell peppers into 1/4" slices.

Spread goat cheese on toasted bread. Add the grilled vegetables; top with onion or scallion and drizzle on reserved marinade.
