Not everyone with a true food allergy will have the same symptoms, but they will all be governed by IgE. Conversely, people with food intolerances, like lactose intolerance, only get digestive symptoms. And listen, we're not here to dismiss the severity of your GI issues. If you're in genuine pain after you eat dairy, shellfish, or eggs, it might be best for you to avoid them. But when allergists are counting people with food allergies, they're not counting you. As the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology notes, these kinds of food intolerances are caused by enzyme deficiencies or some sensitivity to particular chemicals in food (natural or otherwise). Allergies, rather, must invoke the immune system.
