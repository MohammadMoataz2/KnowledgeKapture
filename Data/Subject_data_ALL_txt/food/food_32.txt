    1                pita pocket
     1/4           cup  hummus
     1/3           cup  tabouli
       2   tablespoons  Feta cheese -- crumbled
       1                leaf  romaine lettuce -- torn into pieces
     1/4    tablespoon  tomato -- chopped
     1/4           cup  alfalfa sprouts
       1    tablespoon  Greek olives -- chopped
                        Lemon Dill dressing (see recipe)

Cut top 1/4 from pita pocket and reserve for another use*. Open pocket and spread one side with hummus. Spoon in tabouli. Add remaining ingredients, drizzling salad dressing over all. This serves one, but is easily multiplied for many. 

* Broiled pieces of pita bread are excellent for dipping extra hummus.
