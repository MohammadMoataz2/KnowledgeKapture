If cutting down on calories is your primary goal, you might be tempted to skip other food in order to make room for your unhealthy treats in the plan. But Fung says this is a mistake, because your self-control is at its lowest when you're hungry. Your blood sugar levels have dropped, which means your brain isn't at its most rational, and you're probably in a bad mood. This is when you're most likely to overindulge. That's why Fung says "junk is for once you're full."

Obviously no one is suggesting you go to town on some ice cream when you're already full to bursting from a meal of veggies—you can save some room for the good stuff. But if you make sure to eat treats after real food instead of when you're super hungry, you’ll make better choices about which foods to eat. Plus your ghrelin levels (the hormone that makes you feel hungry) will have dropped, which will decrease your overall desire to eat.
