Fish Oil is a healthy source of good fat
As most people know, fish oil is a healthy source of fat. A recent study suggests that it may also reduce fatty substances found in the blood of those with type 2 diabetes.

The study, which studied over 40 adults taking a supplement with 4 grams of fish oil over 8 weeks, proved that it lowered levels of traicylglycerol, a fatty substance that contributes to heart disease.

They also found that levels of HDL, good cholesterol, rose with those who took fish oil.

The study was reported in the Diabetes Care magazine and reported that those taking fish oil supplements showed LDL and HDL feel by almost 1%. That might not be a lot, but for diabetics, reducing the amount of fat in the blood by any amount is helpful.

While taking fish oil supplements is helpful, eating fatty fish like salmon and mackerel is the natural way to get plenty of fish oils.
