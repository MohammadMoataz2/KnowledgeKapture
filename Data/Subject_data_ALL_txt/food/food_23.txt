     1         pound  chicken ; breasts -- cubed
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  cornstarch
       3                green peppers -- cut into 1/
                        set above ingredients aside
                        sauce
       2    tablespoon  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  soybean paste

Mix the above ingredients well and set aside. Cook chicken  in a little oil and minced garlic.   When the chicken  is  no longer pink, add the bamboo shoots and the green pepper to the wok (or  fry pan if you don't have a wok).  Cook for a minute or two. Sprinkle a little of the rice wine vinegar over the chicken/veggie mixture and cook another minute.  Add nuts and cook another minute.  Pour sauce over the contents of wok and cook until heated through.
