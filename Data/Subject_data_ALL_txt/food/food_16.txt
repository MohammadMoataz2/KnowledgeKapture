  2          cups  all-purpose flour -- more if needed
     1/2           cup  ground almonds
       1           cup  sugar
       2                extra large   eggs
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  amaretto -- or nocello
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
       1           cup  walnuts
       1           cup  blanched almonds -- whole

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; lightly grease 2 cookie sheets with softened butter and dust with flour, shaking off the excess.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground almonds, sugar, eggs, rum, liqueur, vanilla extract, cinnamon and baking powder; beat with a heavy wooden spoon until well blended.  Stir in the walnuts and whole almonds. The dough should be soft and a bit sticky, but it should hold its shape when picked up.  If it is too runny, add more flour.  With your hands, scoop up half of the dough; shape into a long cylinder, about the length of a roll of paper towel.  Place on the cookie sheet so that it does not touch the edge of the pan.  Repeat with the second half of the dough.  Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown and firm.  They will spread during baking.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven to a wire rack; let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.  Carefully loosen the cylinders from the cookie sheets, using metal spatulas.  Let stand on a cutting board until almost at room temperature.  With a serrated bread knife, cut each of the cylinders into crosswise slices about 1-inch thick.  Place the sliced, a cut side up, on the cookie sheets.  Return the cookie sheets to the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes to let the cookies out and turn slightly golden.  Cool completely before storing.
