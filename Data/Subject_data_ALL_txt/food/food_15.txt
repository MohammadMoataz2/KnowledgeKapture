 4          cups  all-purpose flour
       2          cups  sugar
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
       6                eggs
       4   tablespoons  frangelico -- (hazelnut liquor)
       2     teaspoons  vanilla extract
       2     teaspoons  almond extract
       2          cups  hazelnuts, oil-roasted -- coarsley chopped

These biscotti are perfect for dipping in espresso and the sweet Italian wine Vin Santo.  Since these cookies have no added shortening, there is very little moisture.  These cookies are hard, so crunch carefully.  Most important, enjoy!  I have substituted 2 cups roasted chopped almonds for the Hazelnuts and the results have been fine.  Also, I've been thinking about substituting 4 tablespoons of anise liquor for the Frangelico and tossing in a handful of anise seeds.  Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients (except the nuts) together in a bowl.  In a separate bowl mix the liquids.  Mix the liquids into the dry ingredients until the dough is stiff.  Do not overmix.  Stir in the nuts.  Shape the dough into 2 flattish logs 3 inches wide and approximately 15 inches long.  Place the logs on a buttered cookie sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes at 350.  Remove from the oven and let cool to the touch.  Using a bread knife, slice the log crosswise into 3/4 inch pieces. Place the pieces back on the cookie sheet side down.  Bake again for 15 minutes until the cookies are a golden brown.  Store in a tight tin.  Cookies store well for weeks.
