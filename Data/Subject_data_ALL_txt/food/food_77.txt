Not even the most optimistic of nutritionists thinks you'll never touch a piece of cake again. We may assume those who teach people to eat for a living would believe in the elimination of all junk food, but the reality is that even the pros know you'll cave sometimes. And that's okay. You just gotta have a plan.

"Eating is a rest-of-your-life thing," says Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons College. That means whatever your diet plan is, she and other nutritionists want you to be able to stick with it long-term. Unless you have god-level willpower, you're not going to be able to resist sugar foreverâ€”and in fact, nutritionists don't want you to. Fung explains that regardless of the diet you pick, if you go off of it once you've lost whatever weight you want to shed, you'll just end up gaining it back later and losing the benefit of dieting in the first place. It's far better for your long-term health to learn how to make better choices than it is to diet intermittently.

Here are a few tips that Fung recommends to eat healthily while still making room for your favorite cookies.
