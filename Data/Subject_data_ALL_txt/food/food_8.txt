3 1/2          cups  flour
       1           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       2                eggs
                        -----vanilla cream-----
     2/3           cup  sugar
       3    tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       3                egg yolks
       2           cup  milk
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       1      teaspoon  almond extract -- optional

Blend everything in large bowl and mix.  Roll out on floured board and cut with a four inch water glass. Make 12 circles.  Line greased cupcake pan with the 12 circles.  Fill each cup with pastry cream (below). Top each with another circle cut with a 3 inch glass--make sure the cake is sealed.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes at 375.  Let cool completely in pan.  This is my mom's cream-puff cream.  It's just a sweet, vanilla cornstarch pudding.  I'm giving you the microwave recipe, because otherwise it takes an eternity of stirring on the stove, after which your arm will fall off. If you choose to cook it that way, make sure you keep the heat low while you're waiting for the stuff to thicken, and never ever stop stirring, or the cream will stick to the bottom and burn and then you will have a million nasty little brownish-black flecks throughout your pudding, which will do absolutely nothing for the texture.  VANILLA CREAM  In microwave bowl, mix: 2/3 C sugar 3 T cornstarch 1/4 t salt  add a fraction of  2 C milk, a little at first to make a smooth paste, then the rest until the mixture is smooth.  Microwave this at high for 8-9 minutes, stirring every 2 min until the stuff is smooth and thickened.  Meanwhile, put 3 egg yolks (or two whole eggs) into another bowl and beat them slightly.  Quickly stir half of the hot milk mixture into eggs, and then add the new egg mixture to the original milk mixture. Microwave at high 1 to 2 min until mixture is thick and glossy.

Add 1 T butter 1 t vanilla extract (And, optionally, for extra flavor) 1 t almond extract  Let cream cool before adding to cupcakes or creampuffs...  If you're eating it by itself, it's great while it's still warm.
