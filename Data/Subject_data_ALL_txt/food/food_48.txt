  16        ounces  tomatoes
       7        ounces  green chiles -- diced
       1                onion -- cut into chunks
       3          cups  chicken broth -- or homemade turkey
                        stock
       3          cups  cooked turkey -- bite sized pieces
       2          cups  cooked brown rice
       1      10 ounce  wh  kernel corn, frozen
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder

This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers.  I use the carcass to make the stock first.  I throw in any vegetables I want to use up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident.  I simmer the stock about 2 hours or so.  After straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call for, I really don't measure the ingredients, I just add what I've got until it's as thick as I want it and the proportions look right. In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles and onion; whirl until smooth.  Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices.  Reduce heat and simmer until heated through. Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn sometimes too.
