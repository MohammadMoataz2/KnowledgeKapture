OnePlus 8 full specs comparison chart: 8 vs. 8 Pro vs. 7 Pro vs. 7T vs. 7T Pro
Here's how the new OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro stack up against the company's older phones.
The OnePlus 8 and the flagship OnePlus 8 Pro are the latest phones launched by the popular Chinese company. Both are available now and we've already given them the full review treatment. As OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told us exclusively, both phones support 5G which is one of the biggest additions to the range over last year's 7 Pro, 7T and 7T Pro. Expect faster internet speeds and lower latency, as long as you're in an area that supports 5G and you have a compatible phone plan.
