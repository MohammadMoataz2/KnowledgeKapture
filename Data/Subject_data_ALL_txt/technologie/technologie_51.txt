Need a webcam? Get this 1080p Lenovo for $47
The 500 FHD offers some impressive features for the price.
The rise of working and schooling at home has led to a mad scramble for webcams, which are essential for Zoom and Skype calls. Not every laptop has one built in, and they're found on precious few desktop monitors. Thankfully, there's finally a deal to be had on a well-known brand: For a limited time, and while supplies last, the Lenovo 500 FHD Webcam is $47.49 when you apply promo code EXTRAFIVE at checkout. And here's a pro tip: If you start your shopping trip at cash-back service Rakuten, you'll get 8% back. That brings your net total down to around $43.
The Lenovo 500 is a 1080p camera with a USB-C interface, though it comes with a cable that plugs into standard Type-A USB ports. It captures a 75-degree image and can manually pan a full 360 degrees -- nice if you want to swing it around to capture what's happening behind the screen.
