iPhone SE vs. iPhone 8: There's a clear winner for the budget-conscious
Some retailers are still selling the iPhone 8 despite Apple discontinuing the device. But you should just get the new iPhone SE
In a bid to lure budget-minded iPhone fans, Apple debuted its new iPhone SE for 2020 for $399 (Â£419, AU$749). The iPhone SE's specs and looks are similar to the iPhone 8 from three years ago, which is likely the reason why the tech company announced it would discontinue its 2017 flagship on the same day.
