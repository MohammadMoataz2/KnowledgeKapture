Save a lot of time
What benefit me very much is that it saves me a lot of time when using DesignCap. As I talked above, you can only choose a template and replace all the elements on the templates to make it customized. The vast number of art resources will also facilitate your design to save you more time.

DesignCap will help you if you need the results of the design in a short time. Therefore, DesignCap is highly trusted as an online tool that can create designs in a matter of minutes. When compared to making a design using any other editing applications, DesignCap will save you more time.

5. Flexible editing tools
The editing tools in DesignCap are compelling and flexible. If you feel something is missing in the template you have chosen, you can add it to your design using the tools in DesignCap.

You can add photos or images, charts, text, modules, and backgrounds. To add photos or images, click the photos button, then there will display a variety of images in various themes. You can also insert a chart in your design, and the chart can be a pie chart, a bar chart, a line chart, etc. DesignCap offers the option to import data directly from spreadsheets of CSV, XLS, and XLSX.

Likewise, with text, you can add text to your design with a variety of attractive fonts. You can also insert Modules to provide the information you want to convey. And finally, you can change your background design. The available background patterns also are very aesthetic, attractive, and elegant.
